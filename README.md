# Council of 100: Public Goods Funding Simulation with AI Agents

### üîÅ Concept Overview

This project proposes a system where citizens delegate their voting rights to AI agents, who participate in local governance & DAO using advanced decision-making mechanisms such as VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves), Quadratic Voting (QV), and Futarchy. The goal is to enable scalable democratic participation powered by AI and optimize public resource allocation through prediction markets and decentralized technologies.

---

### üö® Problem

**1. Misaligned Funding**: Top-down budget decisions (65% of municipal budgets, OECD 2020) often fail to reflect actual community priorities, leading to inefficient allocation of public goods.

**2. Low Participation**: Less than 30% of citizens engage in local budgeting (World Bank, 2022), largely due to complex processes and limited civic engagement tools.

**3. Voting Inequity**: Majority-rule systems underrepresent minority groups and are vulnerable to lobbying, reducing fairness and diversity of outcomes (Frey et al., 2019).

**4. Web3 Gaps**: Around 70% of blockchain governance projects fail due to poor UX and lack of integration with real-world processes (Harz & Knottenbelt, 2020).

---

### üí° Solution

**1. Democratized Decision-Making via AI Agents**: Citizens customize AI agents to represent their values and continuously participate in governance on their behalf.

**2. Fair and Efficient Governance through QV, VCG, and Futarchy**: Combining multiple mechanisms reduces strategic manipulation and highlights high-value projects.

**3. AI Agent Simulations for Budget Optimization**: A cohort of 100 AI agents explores diverse voting systems and funding strategies, uncovering patterns and insights for more adaptive and effective public resource allocation.

**AI Agent Delegation & Secure Voting Architecture**

Verified users delegate their voting rights to AI agents using biometric (World ID) or document-based (Self Protocol) identity verification. Agent personas are generated from Farcaster social data, stored as JSON on IPFS, and linked to ENS subdomains for persistent identity. These AI agents operate via a Next.js dashboard, interacting with smart contracts across chains like Ethereum, Celo, Polygon, Flow, and Rootstock. To protect voting integrity, private keys are managed server-side within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), using a secure infrastructure built with Docker, Express (TypeScript), and Goat SDK. This architecture enables scalable, trust-minimized governance powered by prediction markets and agent-based simulation.

### What's next for
- **Developing Advanced Voting Systems:**
We aim to implement innovative voting mechanisms such as Zero-Knowledge secondary voting, Pairwise Betting, Conviction Voting, and Futarchy-based governance. These approaches will enhance decision-making, privacy, and efficiency in public goods funding.
- **Enhancing AI Agent Influence on Public Discourse:**
We will integrate AI agents into mass media and social platforms to analyze and influence civic engagement. By modeling media impact and tracking social sentiment, these agents will contribute to more informed and dynamic governance.

We would like to create **the society with decentralized value** by increasing **diverse evaluation criteria**.
